# User List Application

This is my first project using Next.js. The application consumes a user API to list users and display detailed information when clicking on them. It also includes a top navigation bar for easy navigation.

## Features

- **User Listing:** Fetch and display a list of users from an API.
- **User Details:** View more information about a user by clicking on them.
- **Navigation Bar:** A top navigation bar for seamless navigation across the app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-list-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd user-list-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.
